        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello world! My name is Dalin Bac. I'm originally from Cambodia, and I moved to Canada in 2019. It was a major shift in my life, and I'm still adjusting. I'm currently a 1<sup>st</sup> year student in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. I also work part time as an assistant pastry chef and a barista.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose this program because it combines a lot of interesting subjects such as photography, videography, web development, UX/UI design, and graphic design. I have no experience or knowledge in any of these fields, but I'm hoping to learn many skills during these two years. I'm excited to create my first website. Even though it is a really simple one, it is surely a step forward. Kudos to Professor Robinson.
